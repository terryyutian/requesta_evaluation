      <hr />

      <p>
        I am a researcher at the Learning Engineering Institute at ASU and I am requesting your participation as a volunteer
        in the above-named research project. I am conducting a research study to evaluate the quality of multiple-choice
        questions (MCQs) generated by artificial intelligence (AI) systems compared to those written by humans.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am inviting your participation, which will involve:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a demographic survey,</li>
        <li>a vocabulary test,</li>
        <li>a reading and question answering task, and</li>
        <li>a question quality rating survey.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Completing these tasks will take approximately <strong>20 minutes</strong>. You have the right not to answer any question, and to stop participation at any time.</p>

      <p>
        Your participation is completely voluntary. You may choose not to participate or to withdraw at any time without penalty.
        You will be compensated <strong>$6</strong> via the Prolific platform for completing the study.
        To participate in this study, you must be <strong>18 years of age or older</strong> and capable of providing informed consent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although there may be no direct benefit to you, your participation will contribute to the development of AI-powered
        automated writing feedback generation systems for higher education contexts. There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts
        to your participation.
      </p>

      <p>
        No personally identifiable information will be collected, and your responses will remain confidential. Deidentified data
        may be shared as part of the dissemination process through open science repositories (e.g., OSF, Databrary) through
        preregistration of a study or at the request of a publisher (e.g., open access journal), and aggregate results of this study
        may be used in reports, presentations, or publications but your name and other identifying information will not be used.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Prolific Worker ID number will be assigned to you in order to ensure you receive your compensation. However, the ID numbers
        will be deleted prior to data analysis. To ensure responses stay confidential, we recommend you avoid sharing identifying
        information in your responses. The data will be stored for up to <strong>10 years</strong> after the completion of data collection.
        After such time, all data will be deleted from computers and removed from cloud storage.
